g3 - A charting pacakge for js by Eugene Brown

g3 provides functions useful for building data driven web content. It relies
heavily on Mike Bostock's d3[https://github.com/d3/d3] package.

There are a few different types of functions in g3:

- At its core are a set of functions for accessing element properties, setting
margins and creating svg's. All of these functions are named g3.______()
- Functions for creating tables that rely on the core g3 functions. These are
named g3.tables.______()
- Functions for creating charts that rely on the core g3 functions. These are
named g3.charts.______()
